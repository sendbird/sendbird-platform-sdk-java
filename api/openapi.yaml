        \ conversations between up to 100 members. This number can stretch up to tens\

        \ and invite only, or public. They support typing indicators, unread count\
        \ and read receipts, allowing for an interactive chat experience. A user can\
        \ join up to 2000 group channels, and higher numbers would negatively impact\

        \ out blocked users when a user invites a group of users to a new group channel.\
        \ By default, blocked users are included when sending invitations. The value\
        \ of this option can be changed by Sendbird if your Sendbird application isn't\
        \ integrated with the client app. If you want to change the value, [contact\
        \ our sales team](https://get.sendbird.com/talk-to-sales.html).\n    \n- **Turn\
        \ on or off notifications from blocked users**: Determines whether or not\
        \ to receive message notifications from the blocked user in a specific 1-to-N\
        \ group channel where they are both members. By default, a user doesn't receive\
        \ notifications from blocked users. The value of this option can be set individually\

        \ the instructions below:\n\n1. Register the users of your current chat solution\
        \ to your Sendbird application. You can migrate the users into the Sendbird\
        \ system using the [user creation API](https://sendbird.com/docs/chat/v3/platform-api/guides/user#2-create-a-user).\n\
        \    \n2. Create either an [open](https://sendbird.com/docs/chat/v3/platform-api/guides/open-channel#2-create-a-channel)\
        \ or a [group](https://sendbird.com/docs/chat/v3/platform-api/guides/group-channel#2-create-a-channel)\
        \ channel to migrate the messages of your chat solution. The Sendbird system\
        \ doesn't create a channel for your migration automatically.\n    \n3. The\
        \ maximum number of migrated messages per call is 100. To avoid the failure\
        \ during your migration, you must adjust the number of messages to process\
        \ at once via the API.\n    \n\nhttps://sendbird.com/docs/chat/platform-api/v3/message/migration/migrate-messages#1-migrate-messages"
